<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>We learned in our last paper that <a href="https://rzaliznyak-math.github.io/numpy-random-p-value-power/#proper-p-value-practice" target="_blank"><strong>p-values</strong></a> control the rate of <code>False Positives</code> in our experiments — how often we incorrectly declare <code>Statistical Significance</code>.</p>
<p>You may have also heard that <em><strong><code>p-hacking</code></strong></em>, the practice of misusing p-values, should be avoided because it inflates <code>False Positive</code> rates.</p>
<p>While the aforementioned claim is absolutely true, here we will use <em><strong><code>NumPy</code></strong></em> simulations to show that in many cases, it is profitable to engage in <code>p-hacking</code>.</p>

<section id="design-significance-test" class="level1">
<h1>Design Significance Test</h1>
<p>Let’s use our traditional website example.</p>
<p>Assume our existing website converts 50% of customers to paying subscribers.<br> We have a new website we think generates a lift of 101% — or a delta-to-control = 0.50%.</p>
